# CodeHard_U04 Agile DB

![](https://i.imgur.com/k2VfC7j.png)

### General Information

The database is designed and implemented in postgres and will form the basics for a new service that is intended to be launched in 2022. The service will be developed in several different steps and our task is to develop a logical model, an ERD-diagram and a physical model. This physical model will be implemented in postgres.

A medium-sized company has contacted Chas Academy because they decided to build a crossroads between the 90's Community and a specialized e-commerce for pets to take up the fight with Amazon. In addition to the usual functionality that most e-commerce platforms have, they also want to enable networking between users, with groups and messages.

The company wanted to hire a team that had technical expertise but also a genuine interest in animals. Team Codehard was chosen because we are not only specialists in DB design but we have a burning interest in animal welfare and understand what animal owners have in need in a community and in retail.

### Setup

The project started with the following steps:

* Create a group DM on Slack with the members

* Set up a Trello, come up with a name for the group

* Create a public repo on Github. 

    https://github.com/Hessupatteri/Codehard-agiledb-doe21.git

* Estimate all the stories in your backlog

>  User management, incl. ~ 3 roles

>  Groups

> Private posts

> Posts in groups

> Goods handling

> Order handling (incl. Status)

* Make a plan for the first sprint

* Decide when and how we will have our daily standups 

* Appoint a Scrum master for the first week of the project

The team discussed how we should set up the work and started planning with the visual tool Trello. 

We started sprint one by searching good knowledge about the topic. In the next sprint we had a huge brainstorm where we added as many possible attributes that would help to make as good a database as possible.

The sprints "way of working" were changed weekly to optimize the best optimum workflow.
